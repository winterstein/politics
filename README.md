Society | tl:dr; Scotland is nicer than rUK. Most powers are devolved already, but independence would protect. |					
 | Social Contract (welfare & social justice) | | | Scotland has a better social contract than rUK. Independence would
 protect that.
 | Left-wing | | | In Scotland, removing the toxic-Tory effect and fragmenting the SNP are likely to produce a resurgent right-wing (further strengthened by recession). In rUK, the balance of power would shift to the right.
 | Neo-liberalism | | | | Scottish left-wing are hopeful, but mainstream Scottish politics is neo-liberal. The SNP want to cut corporation tax & think beggar-my-neighbour economics is a good idea, and no-one's arguing against them. 							
Governance							
 | Financial Policy | | | | The price of currency union will be . The EU will also want 							
Environment							
	Climate Change						
	Other						
Economy							
International							
	War	Likely stay out of bad wars (e.g. Iraq)		UK military could be part of standing up to e.g. Russia. Although so far we're not.			
	Influence						
NHS | tl:dr; No change. The NHS is devolved.
 | Privatisation of supply (hopsitals, drs) in the UK | | | | Westminster can't touch the Scottish NHS |
 | Funding | | | | Likely to remain high (note that the US funds public health-care more than we do, they just get a very bad deal from their privatised hospitals). Besides, Scotland has control of the budget and its independent revenue-raising powers are adequate for NHS funding. |
EU							
Campaign | tl:dr; Irrelevant! This is not a marketing award we're voting for.
| Negativity | | | | | Both sides use scare-mongering too much, No more than Yes. Oh well.
| Unpleasantness | | | | | Yes is naturally a more out-spoken position and hence has more online a-holes (cybernats). Oh well.
